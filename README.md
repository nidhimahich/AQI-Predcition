# AQI-Predcition

In this paper, a study on the use of machine learning algorithms for forecasting the air quality index (AQI) of 12 Chinese cities is discussed. The objective is to investigate the efficacy of several classification methods and identify the top overall machine learning algorithm for this project. Three classification methods are used to accomplish this goal: Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor, Logistic Regression. The performance of each technique is thoroughly compared and examined in this research, with consideration given to variables including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Several techniques of data preparation, including feature extraction, encoding categorical data, and class imbalance issues, were applied. The paper examines a number of strategies that are used for data pre-processing, including feature extraction, encoding categorical data, class imbalance issues, data normalization methods, and data cleaning techniques. The study's findings provided insight into the extent to which various machine learning algorithms predicted AQI levels.
